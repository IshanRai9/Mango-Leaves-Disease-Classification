<p id="description">A medium sized project and that me and my classmates have worked on. It uses 3 models to Classify Mango Plant Leaves Diseases</p>

  
  
<h2>ü•≠ Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   It uses three different models:
     1\. A Convolutional Neural Network Model (CNN),
     2\. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
     3\. A Visual Geometry Group.
*   The same dataset (provided in the repo) has been used for all three models.
*   Adam optimizer has also been provided for all three models.
*   The Testing Accuracy, Validation Accuracy and Training, and Validation Loss Plots have been provided for all three models.
